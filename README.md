Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Power Review

This folder contains the raw data and code to reproduce the findings of "Empowering Research on Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes" by Dickey, Krafty and Pedersen (2022). The source data of patient counts in each group extracted from 69 studies is contained in the Excel spreadsheet "Dickey Appendix S1.xlsx".  This is read and analyzed by the annoated RMarkdown file "Power-review-with-meta-analysis.Rmd"  This reproduces the key findings of the manuscript, including the meta-analysis to determine the clinically meaningful effect size (56.2% vs. 74.5% seizure free), the calculation of the median statistical power to detect that effect size (18%), and the table of the studies in the 90th percentile for power.

Additional MATLAB code to reproduce Figure 1 is found in the subfolder /MATLAB code/
